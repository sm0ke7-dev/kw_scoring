1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,720
Check my geese control.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,360
No geese. How about that?

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,679
Looks like they have new feces. Oh, none

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,599
of the Okay, cool.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,839
All right. What a way to start the

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,080
video. Um

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,000
All right. So,

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,640
uh

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,760
basically, um I forgot what I was

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,119
leaving off there. What we want to do is

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,199
is you want to iteratively build this

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,200
script. So you're going to calculate one

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,160
score at a time or one set of scores at

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,840
a time and then you'll hold those in

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,719
memory. So but you'll also write them to

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,719
the sheet for auditing, right? So when

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,160
we calculate the location scores first,

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,520
you're going to write them in the sheet

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,879
as a as a step, right? But you're also

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,399
you're not going to go back and then

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,879
reference the sheet and pull that data

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,399
back in because every time you calculate

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,120
from the top, it should run all the

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,800
calculations again. So you're when you

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,039
write to the sheet, you're just saying

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,519
this is what we got here. And that helps

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,520
us audit it later, but you'll then take

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,960
those location scores and keep them in

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,840
memory um for the next operation and and

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,000
so on and so forth. Uh, so that's just

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,080
kind of a point I want to illustrate is

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,799
that you don't want to be as you you

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,960
don't want to write this all at once and

34
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,520
you don't want to um

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,280
you don't want to to to write something

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,040
and then have to go reference it to to

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,680
know what it is because you should be uh

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
handling all of these calculations step

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,520
by step by step by step in one

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,079
operation. But you are writing them out

41
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,840
to different areas for different scores.

42
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,079
And that's like a log or an audit of

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:51,119
what's going on. Um, so, uh, I need to

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,320
see a sheet you got currently with data

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,880
in it. Um,

46
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,600
let me send you the Tampa one.

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,600
Okay, sounds good.

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,680
Okay. And then what I'm going to do

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,400
is I'm going to create a new sheet.

50
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,400
Sheets new

51
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,280
just so we can get this organized.

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,239
Uh

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,120
rank whoops

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,560
score calculator. And eventually we will

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,239
merge the operations right from the one

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
you've written and and the one we're

57
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,160
about to work on.

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,319
Um

59
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,400
so

60
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,400
you've got ranking position ranking URL.

61
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,800
Oh, a lot of interesting areas here

62
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,239
where

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,000
he's not ranking so hot. There's an

64
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,000
Orlando raccoon one here. That's odd.

65
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,400
Definitely room for improvement.

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,720
A lot of wildlife questions here.

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Um, so what I'm not seeing is you got

68
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,120
these sets here which are useful to

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,599
generate these, but I'm not seeing these

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,000
lined up on that other set, which I

71
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,000
would want to see just because

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,120
it's going to help you know how to

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
target the right My gosh, what is going

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
on?

75
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,400
It's going to help you know how to

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,120
target the right um

77
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,159
what I say going to help you know where

78
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,760
to target the right uh row when you want

79
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,760
to write and submit um some new stuff.

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,439
Right? So it looks like you're you're

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,000
dumping your results here, but I'm not

82
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,040
seeing a service geo keyword keyword

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,959
geo. I'm just seeing the keyword, which

84
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,080
is

85
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,200
sort of a different piece of the

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,840
operation, right? Um,

87
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,840
so what I want to see is something like

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,600
this,

89
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,440
but this is not just this is like

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,440
service level stuff. I guess this is

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,840
like your reference sheet for

92
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,840
for your ranking URLs, right? Um,

93
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,880
so let's go into here.

94
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,280
Oh, Gordon, can you share your screen?

95
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,280
Uh,

96
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,280
sorry.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,960
So, what I really want to see

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,880
is this list.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,759
We don't necessarily need the latitude,

100
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,479
longitude, though I think we can grab

101
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,080
them.

102
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,080
So, we're going to call this rankings,

103
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,080
right?

104
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,000
There's that.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,759
And I'm going to come over here

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,280
and get the results, right? And these

107
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,280
should, I'm assuming, match up.

108
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,240
I think these raw responses are are kind

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,240
of what's killing it.

110
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,680
Yeah, I just clicked that like a minute

111
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,680
ago.

112
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,639
Come on. There we go. Good lord.

113
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
All right. And then we're going to come

114
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,320
here and we'll just assume it's

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,639
something like Oh [ __ ]

116
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,680
The hell happened? It took it It took so

117
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,919
long to copy that it actually pasted the

118
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,320
old thing and now it's not loading.

119
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,680
It's the raw responses. I think

120
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:03,039
Yeah, I think so, too.

121
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,600
Is it doing that to you? Uh, no not

122
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,840
really. I mean, it's responding good in

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,840
my end.

124
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,960
Come on now.

125
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,000
Just going to hit copy again.

126
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,319
And then I'm going to try to paste this.

127
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,520
There we go.

128
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,280
All right. So, you got a ranking

129
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,639
position ranking URL, right? So, few

130
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,160
different things going on here. Now, we

131
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,160
got to do our um

132
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,160
niche

133
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,840
location.

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,880
And then I think there's like a keyword

135
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,880
one as well, right? because it's

136
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,240
kind of like that.

137
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,319
And then I think we'll also have a

138
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,319
config at some level.

139
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,280
Come on.

140
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,319
So, several sheets here. You got your

141
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,440
rankings as your set already loaded in

142
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,319
like that.

143
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,960
So then you're going to go back here to

144
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,520
Tampa ranking and you're going to go to

145
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,039
locations

146
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,120
and you're going to grab uh your your

147
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,120
different areas, right? Like all this

148
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,120
information

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,599
here.

150
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,840
And you're going to come over to

151
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:01,639
location.

152
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,639
Paste that in. Oops. We need a column.

153
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,160
There.

154
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,160
Now, I'm unopinionated about the column

155
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,919
names themselves,

156
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,919
but we will make a You said income,

157
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,120
population, and then you did a manual

158
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,440
check.

159
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,680
Yeah, I just had to make sure that uh

160
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,400
what my automation is giving me is uh

161
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,919
accurate.

162
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Okay. And is it like did you find uh

163
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,880
completely accurate or were there

164
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
discrepancies?

165
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,320
They're they're accurate. Yeah.

166
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,519
Okay, great. So, what I'm I'm actually

167
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,039
just going to delete these two columns

168
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,399
because I'm just assuming you're you're

169
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,720
correct in your numbers.

170
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,320
Yeah.

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,560
Um I don't want to I don't want to

172
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
pollute what we've got going on here.

173
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,800
Right. So, then we have to do a location

174
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
score.

175
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,160
And again, I could write this um

176
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,000
uh

177
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,760
write this function myself, but

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,959
basically what we're going to do is

179
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,760
calculate that score. is going to be a

180
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,080
um

181
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,360
a set of keywords. We come back here and

182
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,320
grab our keywords.

183
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,480
So, this should be

184
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,440
your

185
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,440
services and keywords essentially,

186
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,440
right?

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,240
like that.

188
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,839
And then you've got your operation to

189
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,839
generate those um

190
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,880
keyword plus geos which we've already

191
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,800
got like kind of in our

192
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
uh these are like the core keywords.

193
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,480
They are

194
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,519
formatted

195
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,880
in the sort of old way, right? Which is

196
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,480
that they're capitalized. Um I'd rather

197
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,760
them

198
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,279
basically remain formatted like this. Uh

199
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,519
I guess these must have come from the

200
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,079
surges or something.

201
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,680
Yeah.

202
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,360
During our process with that because we

203
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,040
were also I think part of the

204
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,320
capitalization was that we were

205
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,760
preparing like title names and stuff. Um

206
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,760
so we were avoiding that. What?

207
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,640
Sorry about that.

208
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,240
Uh so

209
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,480
I think we so so one of the things that

210
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,600
we have to keep in mind um and one of

211
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,839
the reasons I like

212
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,440
this here uh

213
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
interesting how these calculated it

214
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,920
right because this is a core keyword. So

215
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,640
basically one of the things we have to

216
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,640
do and we're very concerned with is when

217
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,079
you're looking at your rankings, you

218
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:42,720
want to know whether the keyword plus

219
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:45,040
geo is a pure keyword or if it's a um a

220
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,640
location modified one. Right? So in this

221
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,200
case you can see that this one is uh a

222
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,959
pure keyword and this one is location

223
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,399
modified. This one's location modified.

224
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
This one's a pure keyword. This one's

225
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,160
location modified. This one's location

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,880
modified, right? So, how do you

227
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,279
determine that

228
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,640
from a data perspective?

229
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,920
Um,

230
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:11,120
when you're analyzing this sheet,

231
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,120
well, it contains the uh like a location

232
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,639
like an area.

233
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,600
That's hard to to do. I would actually

234
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,880
just say, does this match keyword, do

235
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,680
these two match? They need to be uh

236
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,440
controlled for capitalization.

237
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,120
But you want like you'd be able to say

238
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,600
wildlife pest control, wildlife pest

239
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,519
control. That's a match. Wildlife pest

240
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,920
control, wildlife pest control

241
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,760
riverview, not a match, right? So they

242
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:43,279
have to be like an exact match when

243
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:45,680
controlled for um per uh capitalization,

244
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,000
right? So that's an easy way for you to

245
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,120
determine if you're working with a core

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,720
keyword or if you're working with a

247
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,200
location modified keyword because in our

248
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,120
mindset here and part of this decay

249
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,200
we're talking about that we're trying to

250
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,160
focus on is there is an inherent belief

251
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,079
at least on my end that the raw keyword

252
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,240
is worth more than location modified

253
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,079
keyword because of search volume

254
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,240
generally right people are more likely

255
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,680
to search raccoon removal than raccoon

256
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,800
removal Detroit uh because it's they're

257
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,040
assuming they're going to get some

258
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,120
location aspect to that response. Now,

259
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,440
they might then make that, you know,

260
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,040
search as well. Could be. I can't

261
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,120
necessarily say that the volume is going

262
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,920
to be one way or the other. This is why

263
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,680
we're going to create a

264
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,399
um

265
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,040
a sort of weighted method to be able to

266
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:41,279
discriminate. Uh so um the interesting

267
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,680
thing about algorithms

268
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,519
uh is that they are sort of these

269
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,600
opinionated guesses about data

270
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,279
relationships and why they matter.

271
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,560
Right? So our big opinion in this above

272
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,399
all things other than location specific

273
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
stuff which is more straightforward

274
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,279
because that's about population and and

275
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,120
monetary value within that market. um

276
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,000
which is a pretty safe opinion I think

277
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,120
because you can't make dollar bills come

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,639
out of the earth essentially. Uh the

279
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,040
other opinion we're going to take is

280
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:19,839
that the um base keyword in a market is

281
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:22,720
worth more than the uh location modified

282
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,120
ones. Partly because the base keyword is

283
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,279
a very singular and then the location

284
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,760
modified is very buried, right? because

285
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,680
there's multip multiplication happening

286
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,000
in in their creation. In this case, it's

287
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,800
only times two, but in other cases, it

288
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,800
might be um more uh

289
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,279
so um

290
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,279
what am I thinking here?

291
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,279
Uh

292
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,120
damn, my brain just turned off. Um,

293
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,920
it was one of the people asking for a

294
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,399
goose dog. The guy in Fort Worth was is

295
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,320
like saying, "You have any goose dogs?

296
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,760
Your mom?"

297
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,920
And she doesn't have any yet. So, um,

298
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,519
what was I going to say? Uh,

299
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,360
sorry, my daughter's also crying, so

300
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,000
that's not helping either.

301
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,000
Um,

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,120
where were we? Where did we leave off?

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,920
uh you were uh saying uh weighing of

304
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,360
pure keywords and uh

305
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,120
right so that's an opinion we're taking

306
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,160
too is that the the pure keywords are

307
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,240
work and should be considered as a chunk

308
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,440
that is separate from the location ones

309
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,959
because the location ones are um

310
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,440
probably is as I guess handled less

311
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:47,680
frequently um but also uh the assumption

312
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,440
is that they there's going to be more of

313
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,839
them than there are of the pure keywords

314
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,519
just because of um the the

315
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,880
multiplication aspect and how they're

316
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,240
generated. So if you're allowing the

317
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,519
number of keywords to happen, uh the the

318
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,519
pure keywords are always going to be

319
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,600
outweighed by the the keyword geos

320
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,600
because they multiply. And so if they're

321
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,519
if we're talking about shares of number

322
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,560
of keywords, then you're polluting your

323
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,160
data that way. Now, we're taking an

324
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,680
opinion that they're treated at least

325
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,000
differently. We're not saying that one

326
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,519
has to be worth more than the other uh

327
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,320
necessarily. Um we do in our logarithmic

328
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:30,639
decay place at the the front end of that

329
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:33,040
the the um the pure keywords or core

330
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,120
keywords assuming that they have more

331
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
value. If it we'd have to treat it

332
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,800
differently if we didn't know. But we

333
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,759
are allowing or we're going to create a

334
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,360
value that allows us to do a slider

335
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,120
right um for where that happens. like

336
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,279
where is this cut off point? So if you

337
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,440
got a logarithmic scale and you're

338
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,519
partitioning it into two pieces to say

339
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,079
that one piece is going to be keyword

340
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:00,240
plus geo and the other one's just pure

341
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,240
keyword. Drawing that partition point is

342
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,720
going to be a parameter that we feed

343
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,360
into the equation. Right? So we could

344
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,360
say the only the top 10% are pure

345
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,760
keywords and the rest are 90. uh or we

346
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,839
could say the core keywords are worth

347
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,919
80% and then the last 20% are um

348
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,760
geomodified keywords, right? So we get

349
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,319
the ability to really screw with the

350
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,959
output by changing one number which is

351
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,840
something called uh like abstraction,

352
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,000
right? It's creating an interface for a

353
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,919
user to make very minimal inputs to have

354
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,440
drastic I wouldn't say drastic changes

355
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,640
but um valuable changes, right? they

356
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,160
don't have to go into the code and

357
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,679
rewrite how the code functions because

358
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,280
they can just change one parameter and

359
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,440
get it to move significantly. So that is

360
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,640
one parameter we're going to feed from

361
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:55,679
our config is basically this like uh

362
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,679
partition point in the the that graph of

363
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,679
like on the x-axis like where do we put

364
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:06,240
that you know should the first

365
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,799
uh 50% be this or that and then um there

366
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,720
is another point there too that we'll

367
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,640
issue at the same time called the kappa

368
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,280
and the kappa determines the slope of

369
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,919
the curve. If the cap is at one then

370
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,919
then it's a straight line and if it's

371
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,720
higher than one then it starts to do

372
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,840
this curving motion right so we can we

373
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,960
can make it a flat treatment right

374
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,840
generally um or or have like a linear

375
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,600
descent uh by setting it at one I think

376
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,520
if we do it even less than that then it

377
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,720
even probably does this and maybe comes

378
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,160
to uh some kind of

379
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,320
point I'm not exactly sure what happens

380
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,559
when you go under one um but we will

381
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,039
have a kappa and we will have uh a

382
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,240
partition point basically uh along the

383
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,120
x-axis. Um and so those are the big

384
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,960
deals. Then inside those what we're

385
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,960
doing is saying all right we've got

386
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,520
we're looking at these by location right

387
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,880
so let's let's take a look at the top

388
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,200
calculation because I think it's

389
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,480
important to understand

390
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,799
uh things from the top well one concept

391
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,559
otherwise first I want to bring in here

392
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,600
um have have you ever heard of

393
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,360
normalization before

394
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,640
I've heard of the term I'm not really

395
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,000
sure what it's for

396
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,919
so normalization is basically taking a

397
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
range of numbers numbers that exist,

398
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,799
right? Because they they could apply to

399
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,640
any scenario, right? In some

400
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,799
measurements, you're going to have a

401
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,200
value starting at let's say it's

402
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,840
temperature, right? Like zero Kelvin up

403
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,360
to, you know, whatever Celsius, it's

404
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,799
different. It starts it goes all the way

405
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,160
into the negatives and and you know what

406
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,640
I mean? Like there's different ways of

407
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,120
of calculating like the same thing um

408
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,720
with a with a certain range. To

409
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,280
normalize means that you're creating a

410
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,559
standard scale for all things in the set

411
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,360
to exist between usually zero and one,

412
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,840
but also sometimes negative one and one.

413
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,440
So you're you're probably like, okay,

414
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,440
well, how does that help? Um it helps in

415
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,480
factoring things like mult by

416
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,000
multiplying numbers together because it

417
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,440
allows you to kind of get everything in

418
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,360
the same uh sort of wheelhouse so that

419
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
the the calculations are standard and

420
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,000
consistent. An easy way to think of this

421
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,120
is that we could create a normalized

422
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,679
value for a date and we would do that by

423
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,400
you know you've got 365 days in the

424
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,720
year. October 30th is um let's just

425
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Google it, right? How many days into the

426
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,600
year is October 30th?

427
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,480
We'll say 30.

428
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,799
I don't trust the AI answer.

429
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,679
That's going to be [ __ ]

430
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,960
Day of the year calculator

431
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,240
303 days into the year, right? So what

432
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,559
that means is that if you're going to

433
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,320
calculate a normalized score, you would

434
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,400
do 303 divided by 365.

435
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,039
And if we were to just kind of do that

436
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:08,480
over here in the config and we said 303

437
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,840
/ 365.

438
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,840
Oh, it doesn't want to do the

439
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,840
calculation.

440
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,799
How do you

441
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,799
Why are you treating it like a string?

442
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,679
That's odd.

443
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,720
We'll just do 303

444
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:33,679
365. Oh, I think I know why. Equals this

445
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:38,880
divided by that. And that's a normalized

446
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:41,520
score. You are 83 01369863

447
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,919
through the year. Right? So, you can see

448
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,320
how once you get to 365, you're getting

449
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,640
to a score of one. And on January 1st,

450
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,120
you're at a score of zero. Right. So

451
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,280
that's like a a quick illustration of

452
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,559
like how you get those numbers is not

453
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,919
that complicated. You're usually just

454
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,559
saying like well what is it as part of

455
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,760
the whole if we were to divide the

456
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,200
highest possible value um or divide the

457
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,919
number we're looking at by the highest

458
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,679
possible value what do we get? Right?

459
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,400
So we need a normalization range for

460
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,320
what we're talking about here. Uh the

461
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,880
way that this is logically going to flow

462
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,760
from the top is all about location,

463
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,000
right? because uh it doesn't matter what

464
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,080
a raccoon removal job versus a rat

465
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,280
removal job is worth if there are no

466
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,799
people with no money, right? And that's

467
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,600
what location factors, right? So, um

468
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,640
what we're going to do is we're going to

469
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:40,320
think about a very specific calculation

470
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,159
um which is going to be this uh the one

471
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,480
that you you were doing before, which is

472
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,480
the the income times the population.

473
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,080
We're gonna make a small adjustment to

474
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,559
the income by subtracting like $32,000

475
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,320
basically from it, which is the poverty

476
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,919
like line, right? So, what you'll do on

477
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,039
that first one for Houston is you'll

478
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,720
take the income minus the the uh the

479
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,480
poverty level to get discretionary

480
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,440
income. And then we're going to multiply

481
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,640
that by the uh um population. And that's

482
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,360
going to give us a number. And we're

483
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,799
going to do that for every single row.

484
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,520
And then we're going to take all of

485
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,559
those together and add them up. And

486
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,760
that's going to be our value of one. So

487
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,240
then we can get our our partial score uh

488
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,000
against all of these guys by dividing

489
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,880
their individual score by the total

490
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,280
number and that'll give us that like 0,

491
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,559
you know, 1 2 4 56 or whatever, right?

492
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:41,039
And that'll be our location score. So I

493
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,559
can show you a quick equation for that.

494
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,240
uh and we can run it on the sheet but

495
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,600
you will be writing it and running it in

496
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,600
code because it is something that should

497
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,679
happen when you click the button right

498
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,000
you don't want to you want to derive it

499
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,919
from the raw data you don't want to be

500
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,120
pulling the values from the sheet if you

501
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,679
recall correctly um but I can I can

502
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,120
quickly illustrate what that looks like

503
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,200
so uh we'll call this the score this is

504
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,720
actually hard to calculate without two

505
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,320
columns and this is another reason why

506
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,679
you're using the script so we're going

507
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,000
to call this the um we'll call this the

508
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,799
phase one score

509
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,640
or I would say numerical score and we'll

510
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,640
call this the normalized score.

511
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,559
Okay. So then we're going to say um

512
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,320
equals

513
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,080
this

514
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,080
minus

515
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
32,000.

516
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,960
Generally, we're going to put it in

517
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,960
parenthesis

518
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,400
and then we're going to multiply it by

519
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,400
the population,

520
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,159
right? That's not a small number.

521
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,039
And then you can see how hard it would

522
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,679
be to deal with this because it's

523
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:02,679
insane, right?

524
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,679
Um, so then you'd pull this down

525
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,559
and then you would say, uh,

526
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,919
we could calculate the the just a quick

527
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,880
little note here. So we don't have to do

528
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,360
a bunch of calcs. We could just say, um,

529
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,840
total

530
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:24,559
numerical

531
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:28,159
and that's going to equal the sum

532
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,159
of this through this.

533
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,600
Right. And then you're going to say this

534
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,360
equals this divided by this. But we're

535
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,080
going to take this and turn we're going

536
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,080
to use these uh Whoops. We're going to

537
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,159
put the dollar signs on the I2 so it

538
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:50,600
never changes position as we drag it

539
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,600
down. And now you see

540
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,720
very interestingly

541
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,880
these are the numbers you were looking

542
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,919
at before.

543
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,919
Riverview is 0.08.

544
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,520
Rather interesting, right?

545
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,360
And then these should all sum up to one.

546
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,640
Yeah. See how they all add up to one?

547
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,640
Right.

548
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,320
Cool, isn't it?

549
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah.

550
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:38,000
So then this normalized score is how we

551
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,039
associate what matters most for um for

552
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,200
everything. Now there's an assumption

553
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,480
baked in here that these populations

554
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,159
never intersect with other populations.

555
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,679
We don't really have a good way of

556
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,840
controlling for that. You know what I

557
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,279
mean? You wouldn't you wouldn't really

558
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,480
unless you did like a county level

559
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,400
like analysis as opposed to cities.

560
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,960
However, we're just going to do our best

561
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,919
here. So, it it we're assuming that

562
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,919
there's some level of duplication of

563
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,760
counts going on on like Newport Richie

564
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,159
and Newport Richie East might be not be

565
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,320
the same piece or they may be they may

566
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,120
overlap and so therefore some people are

567
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,960
counted twice. What are you going to do?

568
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,679
Uh we're just looking for general

569
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,679
relative accuracy and not like atomic

570
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,840
accuracy. So it's less of a big deal. Um

571
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,760
so then

572
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,640
the what you can see off of these is

573
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,840
that they do filter down in terms of

574
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,039
importance. Something like Separ is

575
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,279
worth far less to us to rank well in

576
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,840
than something like St. Petersburg which

577
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:49,120
is actually getting a 0.1. I don't see

578
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,080
any other 0.1s here. Almost everything

579
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,279
else has got a zero.

580
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,159
You know what I mean,

581
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,120
right?

582
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,120
Is Tampa on the list?

583
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,080
I don't see Tampa on the list.

584
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,039
Those are just I think the uh

585
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,720
neighborhood.

586
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,840
Make sure the core location is also

587
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,039
included in your calculations in in your

588
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,960
searches, right? Um because that's going

589
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,960
to be a big population zone and we'll

590
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,440
throw your numbers off. But St.

591
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Petersburg clearly has a big population

592
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,520
and a decent income. It's not too bad.

593
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,600
Uh so there's definitely some money to

594
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,240
go around and this is a good one to

595
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,480
target. Right. We we're already getting

596
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,039
insights

597
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,840
on that stuff. Um some of these other

598
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,960
ones aren't so bad either. A point4 not

599
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,440
so bad. Decent income kind of high

600
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:48,240
population, right? So there's potential.

601
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,760
Um, now

602
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,600
we got a total numerical. We got the

603
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,080
normalized score. So now the way to

604
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,760
think about this is we'll go over to a

605
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,760
mind node or mind map here.

606
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,720
It opening up. What's going on?

607
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,600
Let's create a new one.

608
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,559
So, you're going to talk about um sort

609
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,559
of total potential score,

610
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,960
which is going to equal one. And then

611
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,640
let's let's look at three locations,

612
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,760
right?

613
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,760
So, we're going to say Riverview is 0088

614
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,679
0.088 088.

615
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,880
No, not what I wanted to do.

616
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,799
We'll just use a couple as an example.

617
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,960
Trinity

618
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,960
0

619
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,960
20.

620
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,240
Let's get rid of

621
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,159
And then we'll do one more, right? Which

622
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:12,600
will be

623
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,600
something really bad. Odessa.

624
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,240
So you can see immediately that Odessa

625
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,960
is like worth 10% of what Riverviews

626
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,480
were, right?

627
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,480
which is kind of crazy. It's actually 11

628
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,399
less than 10%.

629
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,000
Um,

630
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,760
so you know that that kind of gives you

631
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,399
a lot of insight on what to target. Like

632
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:51,600
any effort you put into Odessa is worth

633
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:54,159
a tenth of what it is into Riverview. So

634
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,679
that's a good calculation for us and why

635
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,000
we're calculating this score at this

636
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,960
stage because it matters to us. And then

637
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,200
we're going to dovtail into sort of like

638
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,679
the uh services calculation, right? So

639
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,200
the services themselves are worth

640
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:14,159
different things. Um this is calculated

641
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,840
and if you if you recognize

642
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:21,840
this sort of set of columns is exactly

643
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:25,120
what we did in the uh in the Google ads

644
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,559
keyword planner. We we just took took a

645
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,159
couple figures. We like found the mean

646
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,760
and we multiplied it by the population.

647
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,760
Same thing, right? Like what is the the

648
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,919
cost per click of this keyword for this?

649
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,360
And then we had an analysis chart where

650
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,880
we were like, let's check bat. What is

651
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,159
bat worth as a share of the market? What

652
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,440
is this worth as a share of the market?

653
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:45,360
What is that worth as a share of the

654
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,679
market? Um and uh basically created a um

655
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,440
a calculus for you know like what to

656
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,960
focus on right uh in terms of like

657
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,120
keywords and the share of market and

658
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,960
stuff. um and also help us rank order in

659
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,279
our keywords. So what you would want to

660
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,720
do then is per service find that number

661
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,000
where you would go into the keyword

662
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,880
planner and that market. You'd say,

663
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,360
"Okay, we're going to get all the

664
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,440
raccoon ones and and then you'll you'll

665
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,240
try to find every raccoon keyword and

666
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,440
then add up that that value of the share

667
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,799
of market, right?" Um so that'll tell

668
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,320
you, you know, it might be 111 or 14 or

669
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:26,159
something like that. And then you would

670
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:28,399
take that and put that into a um

671
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,120
what is it? We'll call it the niche.

672
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,279
You're going to have the niche.

673
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,120
You're going to have the service and

674
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,519
then you're going to have the uh keyword

675
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,519
planner score

676
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,039
keyword.

677
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,039
And then you would do a numerical or you

678
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,640
would you would basically do a

679
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,240
normalization of that. Right? So you

680
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,679
might not be tracking all of the

681
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,600
services that you have in that set. So

682
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,440
let's say we're not focusing on RAT

683
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,840
right now, which is going to be a pretty

684
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,519
big part of any uh any calculation from

685
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,600
the keyword planner. If you're including

686
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,640
RAT in keyword planner, it's going to

687
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,399
make everything else look anemic, right?

688
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,480
So, um, you have to go for,

689
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,799
uh,

690
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,679
let's see, trying to think, my brain is

691
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,440
turning off again. Um, basically, you

692
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,120
want to pull their their normalized

693
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,720
scores from that, put them in this, and

694
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,399
then renormalize them against their own

695
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,080
axis so that you're not including RAT if

696
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,840
you don't want to factor RAT because

697
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,320
otherwise it'll skew your calculations

698
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,159
quite a bit. Um, you can add RAT in

699
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,760
later, and then that'll sort of tip over

700
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,880
the milk cart because it really does

701
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,880
change things. But having created the

702
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,640
right format, all you have to do is add

703
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,240
rat and change it and it won't change

704
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,679
like everything else if you know what I

705
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:58,799
mean. Um, so uh that's that. And then

706
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,039
the other implicit score here uh I I'll

707
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,799
let you fill these in um and then make

708
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,519
the normalization.

709
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:10,159
Do you if if I were to say, you know,

710
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,159
raccoon,

711
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,399
squirrel,

712
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,320
bat,

713
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,639
etc. And I were to have, you know, score

714
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,639
of 0.15

715
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,240
uh 0.08.

716
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:32,200
These are obviously not very high. And

717
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,200
then we'll say this one's 0.12.

718
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:42,679
You would basically sum those the same

719
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,679
way like we did on the other set. What

720
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,960
are you kidding me?

721
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,960
4.

722
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:00,599
And then you would you would divide this

723
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,599
by this.

724
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,720
And then you see how we get the

725
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,720
normalized scores again.

726
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,040
So they sort of get resuscitated from

727
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,520
from being low scores in the other

728
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,440
context, if that makes sense. And then

729
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,320
these are the scores we're working with.

730
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,480
So, what you would notice is that your

731
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:28,320
services are um

732
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,320
you know, you got your bat, raccoon,

733
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,320
squirrel.

734
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,280
You know, again, just as an example,

735
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,480
you'd be taking these numbers and

736
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,480
factoring them here.

737
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,560
So, this gives you your location

738
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,560
and then generally your niche, right? Uh

739
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,480
because all we're doing with the

740
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,880
keywords is rank ordering them. Um they

741
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,320
in my mind they don't matter so much. It

742
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,599
kind of comes down more to the uh

743
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,560
there's a few different ways to handle

744
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,119
it, right? You could

745
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,280
you could do a decay function on the

746
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,839
actual keyword list order for the core

747
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,920
keywords if you wanted. I decided to

748
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,400
just take an average so that you get the

749
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,400
chunk and then you just say we got five

750
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,640
keywords, they're all worth oneif of

751
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,560
whatever that first partition is worth.

752
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,720
Um because I I just don't see a huge

753
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,960
difference in raccoon removal and

754
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,119
raccoon control necessarily. You know

755
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,560
what I mean? Um, maybe there is, maybe

756
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,960
there isn't. Hard to tell. Uh, I think

757
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,640
that if you really wanted to to get

758
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,119
super analytical about it, you'd dive

759
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,960
deeper into that keyword planner data,

760
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,480
but I want something that's robust

761
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,079
enough to work for uh a small market,

762
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,160
right? So, I don't want to be too

763
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,640
opinionated about the actual search term

764
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,960
because you might be missing search

765
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,520
terms because the keyword data from the

766
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,400
keyword planner too sparse to properly

767
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:15,440
plan for mobile. You know what I mean?

768
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:21,119
Um, so uh

769
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:23,440
yeah, that's generally the idea. Um

770
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,200
so you can see that

771
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,079
this is like a filter like a power

772
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,320
filter out of one possible total

773
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,839
riverview is worth this and then it gets

774
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,000
split up that 088 gets split up like

775
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:43,119
this accordingly based on the niche

776
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:45,760
right so then based off of whatever um

777
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:50,640
this is times this right because you

778
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:53,440
multiply these Uh so if we were to say

779
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,440
just again on this rank score thing, if

780
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,440
we were to say raccoon uh service in

781
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Riverview,

782
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,599
we would calculate a score and the score

783
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,440
would be this number times this number.

784
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,520
So 0.088

785
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,200
088

786
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:22,000
times this number that would be equals

787
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:25,760
this times this

788
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,400
it would be worth like a 0.03 03, right?

789
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,400
I think that's right.

790
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,640
Maybe it's divided by

791
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,480
Hold on.

792
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,359
Oh, that's correct. Yeah, because it's a

793
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,720
fraction of this. That makes sense. 0.03

794
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,480
777. Okay. Yeah, because again, this

795
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,960
would equal one when when the others are

796
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,520
composed together. So that means that

797
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,240
all raccoon keywords are all going to be

798
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,560
taking a share of this score if that

799
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,880
makes sense. And you've got in your

800
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,079
rankings

801
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:09,119
raccoon control and riverview is going

802
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:12,400
to be this many keywords like that. So

803
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,160
you could say um

804
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,000
that they're all equally weighted and

805
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,480
they all take an equal share. But we do

806
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,480
want to weight these

807
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,240
core keywords a little differently.

808
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,040
Actually, there's more here, right?

809
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:30,520
Raccoon removal near me, right? Those

810
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,520
ones. So we know that

811
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:41,800
amongst those there are core keywords

812
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,800
and there are um the uh geo keywords

813
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,280
and we're going to factor those as a

814
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:54,160
share by whatever we set this in the

815
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,400
config the um we'll call it the

816
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,280
I got to look at chatbt and and figure

817
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,280
out what we were calling it.

818
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,119
There's a kappa value and a uh

819
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,160
what's it called here? a split

820
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,000
call the partition split

821
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:29,599
and that's going to be between 0 and

822
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:33,520
one. So if we were to say 0

823
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:38,560
uh six six that means that the

824
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:40,480
everything between zero and 66 is

825
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,839
basically a score band that we would

826
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,760
consider um the core keywords and then

827
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,320
everything 66 and up to one which is 044

828
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,160
would be uh the share that's calculated

829
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,320
for the core keyword and then we would

830
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,359
have a kappa value and we would set the

831
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,960
kappa at maybe five or something to to

832
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,640
generate. Usually you'd be setting at

833
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,319
one for that straight line. Um, which we

834
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,160
could do for now and then we could test

835
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,480
the capillator, right? And change it

836
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,960
around. Not too big a deal. So, um, that

837
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,200
means those those first five keywords

838
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:21,040
share 66% of the total possible score in

839
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,880
terms of that area on a linear axis. And

840
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,200
if you were to increase the cappa then

841
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,560
this would only that that potential

842
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,800
would only increase. Uh how you doing?

843
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,160
Are you lost yet?

844
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,920
Still following.

845
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,319
Okay, good. Um so I've got the formula

846
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,160
like I I already had this written uh

847
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,000
because I figured I was going to like

848
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,760
throw it at you and then I didn't really

849
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,200
want to like

850
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,400
overwhelm you with it because it might

851
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,720
be kind of crazy. Um but you can see

852
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,640
here that we're adding these parameters

853
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,160
in right so you got a param which was

854
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,680
the number split which is that first one

855
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,640
we had which is a split point between

856
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,839
zero and one IG eg66

857
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,920
then you're just going to give it a list

858
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,960
of core keywords and a list of geo

859
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,480
keywords. So that's going to be you're

860
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,200
going to do a quick analysis on the

861
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,040
sheet only on Riverview, right? Let's

862
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,800
just only focus on this one thing

863
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,880
because you want to you want to compute

864
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,560
these in their own chunks. You don't

865
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,839
want to calculate Riverview and another

866
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,599
one at the same time because you're

867
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,480
trying to you're trying to divide up

868
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,319
shares and so you know that location is

869
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,160
like your big domain. So you don't want

870
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,160
to be crossing over locations and and

871
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,160
calculating shares for keywords in

872
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,400
Riverview against shares and other other

873
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,160
pieces because they they're irrespective

874
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,400
of each other if that makes sense. Um so

875
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,160
when you build this and you calculate

876
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,960
scores, you want to go location by

877
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,720
location, service by service,

878
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,319
location being first, then do service,

879
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,640
service, service. But you'll be doing

880
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,920
keyword calculations, right? So um when

881
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,839
you come down here, you got your core

882
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,359
keywords and your geo keywords. Let's go

883
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,119
back to the script so you can see the

884
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,560
logic in here. Um, so you're adding a

885
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,319
string of core keywords and you're

886
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,800
adding a string of geo keywords. Those

887
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,960
are literally just the actual values of

888
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,480
the keyword itself.

889
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,560
So it'll be wildlife pest control,

890
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,119
wildlife. We're talking about raccoons.

891
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,599
So you'd be doing your core keywords

892
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,640
would be raccoon removal, raccoon

893
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,079
trappers, raccoon removal.

894
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,200
Oh, it's a different it's spelled

895
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,599
differently. Oh, with one Z. Okay, good.

896
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,160
And then raccoon removal near me and

897
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,400
raccoon removal from attic. Right? So

898
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,480
you got five core keywords. You're

899
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,119
matching them against these. That's how

900
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,040
you develop that list. And then you've

901
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,960
got your your list of the location

902
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,119
modified. So that's your raccoon removal

903
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,359
riverview, your riverview raccoon

904
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,000
removal. So that's a list of like 10 and

905
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,880
the other one's a list of five. And they

906
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,920
are quite literally um

907
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,839
given to you.

908
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,319
Uh you're you're giving them the actual

909
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,720
string because the output object is

910
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,800
going to look like

911
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,119
um let me pull up a new

912
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,640
the output object is going to look like

913
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,760
you know raccoon removal

914
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,200
and it's going to say you know 0.01234

915
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,880
01 23 4 five or whatever, right? And

916
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,440
then you're going to have a comma and

917
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,240
it's just going to be this this list

918
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,920
that comes back of all of those

919
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,880
keywords. There'll be 15 of these

920
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,839
including the location modified, right?

921
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,359
Um, and then you'll you will go when

922
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,720
you're writing back to the sheet, you

923
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,200
will go look up riverview

924
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,480
uh and then you look up the the actual

925
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,160
keyword plus geo to find the row, right?

926
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,040
So, you're going to come in here. You're

927
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,040
going to search

928
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,079
basically through this entire list or

929
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,160
whatever. Actually, we're going to do it

930
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,839
over here because this is the cleaner

931
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,240
cleaner one. You're going to come here

932
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,839
and you're going to look for only

933
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,880
Riverview. And then you're going to go

934
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,240
look for keyword plus geo equals raccoon

935
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,240
removal. And then we're going to go into

936
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,920
that column and write the the um the

937
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,160
actual keyword score, which we'll we'll

938
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,160
add here.

939
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,560
And then of course we're going to have

940
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,720
one later for the ranking score which is

941
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:21,040
like a final step right. So you

942
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,880
basically produce an object from this

943
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,640
calculation. The script will do that for

944
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,520
you where it'll it'll make that output

945
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,240
object and it should give you the right

946
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:34,160
value. I have not tested it. It is not

947
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,720
very long. Right? That's the beauty of

948
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,720
you know math that makes sense and works

949
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,720
well. Right.

950
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,240
Um, and then of course it has a little a

951
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,160
little test here. I don't really know

952
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,960
how it's making it go. It's creating an

953
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,240
array from length 60. This is the thing

954
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,079
I don't understand. Like what are you

955
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,880
guys doing? Uh, I think it was just

956
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,800
trying to cheaply generate geo keywords

957
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,599
off of this. Um, as an example, uh, but

958
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,040
you can see that literally this is the

959
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,599
type of thing it's looking for with

960
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:09,280
keywords. It should be very easy to get

961
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:11,520
for you, right? Um, so that process will

962
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,240
write us out when you're when you're

963
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,599
factoring these inputs correctly. Um,

964
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,960
you're going to get a keyword score. Uh,

965
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,160
the only thing I think we're missing

966
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,160
here is that

967
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,520
we do keyword score.

968
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:32,520
Hold on. And then we got to multiply it

969
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,520
by

970
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,800
uh

971
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:46,680
I got to add this in. say, "Hey, for the

972
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:46,680
script, uh, we need to add in a param

973
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,640
to multiply

974
00:46:51,119 --> 00:47:00,880
the uh

975
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:04,160
the keyword scores by a single location

976
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:09,040
um score

977
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,040
or location service score, right?

978
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,880
because we're having to do this times

979
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,920
this.

980
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:21,359
Actually, I don't think it

981
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:22,800
is required at that level. Hold on.

982
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,359
There's just a step where these things

983
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,920
get factored, right? Um, so I'm just

984
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:29,599
trying to figure out

985
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,160
whether we should bake that into this

986
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,240
script or keep it separate and handle it

987
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,640
at the end.

988
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,640
uh is actually a good engineering

989
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,640
question.

990
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,119
So we could permute a

991
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,040
well the geo scores are always going to

992
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,280
be I think you want to do it at this

993
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:56,240
step because the geo scores are always

994
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:59,240
going to be um a factor of

995
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,240
uh

996
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:05,520
that basically they'd always be the same

997
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:09,599
if you weren't

998
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:14,160
factoring um

999
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:15,680
Actually, this is a good good question

1000
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,839
and I might have to think about it a

1001
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,359
little bit more.

1002
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:22,880
Um, but the the question is usually like

1003
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,000
if you're creating all these scores at

1004
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,079
the end of the day when you look at one

1005
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,839
of those weird math equations, it's just

1006
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,200
saying we're going to take this score

1007
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,400
and we're going to multiply it by this

1008
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,359
score and then we're going to add this

1009
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,119
score and then we're going to divide

1010
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,559
them all by this score. Right? That's

1011
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,400
usually what you're looking at even

1012
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,319
though it's all crazy letters and

1013
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,920
numbers and stuff. Um so the then the

1014
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,839
question becomes um do we want to as

1015
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,920
this progresses be making those

1016
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:51,119
calculations or do we want to take

1017
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,760
produce a list of scores um then produce

1018
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:57,440
a list of modified scores then produce a

1019
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:03,880
list of like fully rank qualified

1020
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,880
scores. Um, and I kind of want to

1021
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:15,040
I kind of want to keep the keyword score

1022
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,720
um as brain dead as possible. So, it it

1023
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,520
means that we're going to be doing a lot

1024
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,599
of calculations

1025
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,400
uh

1026
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,040
specifically.

1027
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,200
Yeah, that's fine. I don't mind handling

1028
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,319
them in layers.

1029
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:35,359
So, we won't worry about pushing a

1030
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,480
location and niche score in there

1031
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,880
because we're just going to do that all

1032
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,800
at the end in our uh in our rank

1033
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,280
calculation. It means we're going to add

1034
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,400
a third column. Basically,

1035
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,680
we're going to have our um keyword

1036
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,280
score, our rank modifier, um and then a

1037
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,839
final score. And the final score is

1038
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,520
going to be everything zipped up. Uh,

1039
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,839
and then that'll be the number we use

1040
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,640
for the keyword itself to say, okay,

1041
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:04,480
this keyword in Riverview is worth this

1042
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,640
at this rank, right? If we're ranked

1043
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:11,599
number one, we get this boost. Um, so

1044
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:15,760
that's all we do. So, you got a keyword

1045
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:19,200
score, rank modifier score,

1046
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,160
and then a final score.

1047
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,319
So the final score,

1048
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:27,280
the the rank modifier score is just

1049
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:29,839
going to be a measure of how we want to

1050
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:35,720
handle um

1051
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:35,720
we'll say uh rank modification kappa.

1052
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:44,400
Let's do the same thing.

1053
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,160
So the way I want to handle um the kappa

1054
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,920
is the same thing, right? Where it does

1055
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,720
like the linear. So, we're going to

1056
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,680
actually put this at like a a 10, I

1057
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,359
guess. Um, where we know the first one

1058
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,200
is worth a lot and the second one is

1059
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,640
worth way less but still worth more than

1060
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,760
the rest. And then as you get further

1061
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,200
out to 10, they're just like worth

1062
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,839
almost nothing, right? And, um, I don't

1063
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,520
think the 10 has anything to do with the

1064
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:13,359
actual rank we're checking. Um,

1065
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:16,880
but what I'm thinking is

1066
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:18,480
if you if you see a ranking above 10,

1067
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,119
you're just basically counting it as

1068
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:25,200
worth nothing, right? So, this this 12

1069
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:30,480
would be a zero effectively. Um, I'm

1070
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:33,680
kind of curious. Road control squirrels.

1071
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,680
He's not doing too bad there. Um,

1072
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,319
even here, he seems a little weak on

1073
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,720
squirrel. Squirrel

1074
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:43,359
removal

1075
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:47,040
pretty good. Squirrel pest removal.

1076
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:49,440
Using words like pest exterminator

1077
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,640
definitely weaker but still not bad. You

1078
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,640
know what I mean? Like he's ranked four

1079
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:57,760
or five. Could be worse. What were the

1080
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,319
What's Riverview's worth? 0088. I want

1081
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,359
to say St. Petersburg.

1082
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:07,319
That was the big one, right?

1083
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,319
Let's go check St. Petersburg.

1084
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,880
St. Peters.

1085
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,800
What the hell?

1086
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,200
I'm getting too excited here. Wow. St.

1087
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,680
Petersburg seems to be ranking quite a

1088
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,960
bit over in Trinity.

1089
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,359
Not great though. Look at those

1090
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,880
rankings. Aren't very good. Temple

1091
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:34,559
Terrace. There we go.

1092
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,160
A lot of ones, threes, twos.

1093
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,880
We could get these raccoons higher would

1094
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,880
be a big boost for him.

1095
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:47,359
Not bad overall in St. Petersburg for it

1096
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:50,559
being worth so much.

1097
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:53,200
Did we do a surge over there?

1098
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,480
Uh yeah, I think we did uh one for St.

1099
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,800
Petersburg.

1100
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,839
Aha.

1101
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,839
Look at those results, baby.

1102
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,599
So yeah, I'm actually quite pleased with

1103
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,640
that because you know, you you look at

1104
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,960
this and you're like, man, St.

1105
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,559
Petersburg is worth so much and then

1106
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,480
we're just slapping it over there. So

1107
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,520
this gives you really good if the surge

1108
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:18,800
is effective in what it does. This gives

1109
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,880
you a really good target list for surges

1110
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,839
so you're not wasting time. You know

1111
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,559
what I mean,

1112
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,800
right?

1113
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,559
Um which is quite cool because you can

1114
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:33,880
have an impact for sure. Uh so where

1115
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,880
were we? Uh raccoon.

1116
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,200
Uh all right. So we were going to

1117
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,760
calculate these scores, right? So

1118
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,440
in the rank score, sorry, I know this is

1119
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,280
taking a while, but I'm hoping to kind

1120
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,559
of get some of this across because I I

1121
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,559
want to give you enough that you can

1122
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:52,800
start working this

1123
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:55,359
um and and deal with these pieces. Uh

1124
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,359
let's go back to I think this is it. We

1125
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:00,400
are we are actually here. So you got a

1126
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,920
keyword score, a rank modifier score. We

1127
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,720
already talked about how to calculate

1128
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,200
that. It's basically this formula. The

1129
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,160
challenge you're going to have is and

1130
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,880
I'll give you this right now.

1131
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:17,240
Copy this code. I'll even share the chat

1132
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,240
with you if it's useful.

1133
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,319
Copy the link. See if you can see this.

1134
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,720
All right.

1135
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,640
I want to try checking this in a

1136
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,640
different browser.

1137
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,359
Yeah, chat open.

1138
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,960
Interesting.

1139
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:04,680
Should check and see if uh we can get

1140
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,680
links out from this

1141
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,559
cuz I'm not logged in. You see that?

1142
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,920
Yeah.

1143
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:21,359
That would be a good experiment. See if

1144
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:25,119
you can't um get it to put links in.

1145
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:26,800
You to go uh get it to write an entire

1146
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:32,079
article about squirrel removal and say,

1147
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:34,800
"Hey, uh can you tell me what the um

1148
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:41,640
squirrel removal

1149
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:41,640
page URL is for AAAC wildlife removal

1150
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,800
of Tampa?

1151
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:56,760
There's a link out here. Source here.

1152
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,760
Share chat.

1153
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:03,680
Copy link.

1154
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,839
Go over here.

1155
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,839
Paste this in. Sorry, I'm getting on a

1156
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,839
tangent.

1157
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,680
Inspect element.

1158
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,280
Maybe the page source isn't the right

1159
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,280
one. Inspect element.

1160
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,960
Oh, it tries to take you off page.

1161
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,119
Interesting.

1162
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,520
Yeah. I wonder if this uh stops it from

1163
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:30,520
being worthwhile.

1164
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,599
I have to assume we would have heard

1165
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,280
about this if uh it was so easy.

1166
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,640
Yeah.

1167
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:50,200
But always something worth testing,

1168
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,200
right? Um anyway uh

1169
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,359
so

1170
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,200
we calculate

1171
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:04,880
the the keyword score which is just that

1172
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:06,720
um that analysis right of the uh

1173
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,960
the full potential of those things. And

1174
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:13,760
this what you'll notice when you do this

1175
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:16,079
is that they'll repeat, right?

1176
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,319
Like wildlife pest control is always

1177
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,960
going to be worth the same keyword score

1178
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:22,000
regardless of location and so are these

1179
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,160
other terms.

1180
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,400
If we're if we're not multiplying that

1181
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,160
other number there,

1182
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,280
um then those keywords are going to be

1183
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,280
work uh

1184
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,200
what is it? [ __ ] So wildlife pest

1185
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,760
control is going to be the work the same

1186
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:41,200
in Riverview as it is in Newport Richie

1187
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,000
as it is in everything else because

1188
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,920
we're not multiplying the location or

1189
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,920
the niche pieces in there. So they'll

1190
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,839
all be normalized against themselves if

1191
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,680
that makes sense. Like that whole set of

1192
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:56,319
raccoon ones will be worth one uh no

1193
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:58,799
matter what. And then so the Newport

1194
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:01,440
Richie raccoon removal will be worth the

1195
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:02,640
same as um St. Petersburg raccoon

1196
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,400
removal because they're the same

1197
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:08,480
pattern, right? Um, so, uh, you'll

1198
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,520
notice that those scores look very

1199
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:14,480
similar when you run it just that way

1200
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:16,160
down the list because they are in fact

1201
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,599
the exact same calculation happening,

1202
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,400
which is why I was kind of hung up. I

1203
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,400
was like, is it worth doing that and and

1204
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,880
putting them there? But in fact, it it

1205
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,119
is because it's easier to audit the

1206
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,520
actual math at the end of the day. Um

1207
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,680
because we have discrete scores in all

1208
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,920
the columns and we can take a sample and

1209
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:37,520
add them up and see if they make sense.

1210
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,119
Um because they should, right? Uh so so

1211
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,640
that those keyword scores will be pretty

1212
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,799
linear set. And then you're going to do

1213
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,839
this rank score which is basically just

1214
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:49,839
going to be like this number exists on a

1215
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:52,000
plane from 1 to 10. If it's if it's

1216
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:55,200
worth more than 10, it's it's worth

1217
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,440
zero, right? Uh and then we're just

1218
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,599
going to apply a very simple curve

1219
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,359
analysis, too. We'll have a kappa in

1220
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,280
there. So, we can we can make it linear

1221
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,799
or we can make it bend really hard, but

1222
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,559
we're going to say one is worth this,

1223
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,160
two is worth that. And that'll be that

1224
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,000
other column, too. And those are all

1225
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,319
going to look the same as well because

1226
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,440
that should be a flat calculation and

1227
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:18,000
it's irrespective of other calculations,

1228
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,920
if that makes sense. And then that last

1229
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,559
score is going to take all the other

1230
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,720
scores together and factor them. It'll

1231
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,040
be this keyword is going to be this

1232
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,799
location score times this niche score

1233
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,359
times this keyword score times this

1234
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:34,000
ranking score. And the final score is

1235
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,319
that. You see what I mean? And then that

1236
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,799
final score on all those is the gold

1237
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:41,359
mine because it tells you how much your

1238
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:43,599
rankings are worth

1239
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:46,720
versus assuming what your rankings are

1240
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:49,440
worth. And I can guarant [ __ ] te you

1241
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,680
that nobody else has that in their

1242
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,920
system. It is a unique novel product

1243
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:57,040
that doesn't exist. And think of it like

1244
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,359
this. Not only can you do that for your

1245
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,359
company, you can do it for all the

1246
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:04,000
competitors at the same time because you

1247
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:07,040
have that raw response format stuff. So

1248
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,520
you can literally see market share by

1249
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:11,280
organic search penetration

1250
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:14,079
on those terms for that you're competing

1251
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,160
for. So you know who's your big

1252
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,839
competitor and where are they? You can

1253
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:19,440
see when you go into Riverview it's this

1254
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,839
guy, but when you go into St. Petersburg

1255
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,119
it's this guy.

1256
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,280
Who are you fighting against and where

1257
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,920
are you fighting them? Very interesting.

1258
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,000
The map stuff is similar like the geog

1259
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,520
grids, but it doesn't come it doesn't

1260
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,200
bring with it the value part, the actual

1261
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,119
money.

1262
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,880
You know what I mean? That's left as an

1263
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,440
assumption. Um, and that's that's I

1264
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,359
think the killer piece is like money

1265
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,240
times population and then you do your

1266
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:50,559
rank assumption and you're valuing your

1267
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,480
service against your other services and

1268
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,720
what the market could provide. Am I

1269
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,359
targeting the right service, you know?

1270
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,079
Um, so there's some some cool [ __ ] to be

1271
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:01,839
found in here uh as we figure this out

1272
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:06,240
because again, like I said, nobody's got

1273
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:08,319
that. um if our if our data for SEO

1274
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,599
rankings are accurate. That's like the

1275
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:12,000
big question because they're sort of the

1276
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,799
cheapest, right? Um I have no idea how

1277
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,440
many credits we're burning through

1278
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:19,599
as we do this. Um but you know, the

1279
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,000
cheapest the cheaper your rank tracking,

1280
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:26,640
the better. Um and you may even be able

1281
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:29,040
to uh segment your your keyword plus geo

1282
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:31,440
to a different rank tracker from your

1283
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,599
your more important terms. So, as the

1284
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,079
keywords become less important, you use

1285
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,920
a a cheaper method of researching them,

1286
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,520
but the the the really important

1287
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,960
keywords you're really rank tracking and

1288
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:42,240
checking because that's it matters to

1289
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:46,480
get those right. So, you might use a

1290
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:49,920
different API um on that one. Uh so,

1291
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:52,000
anyway, this is uh basically what's

1292
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:56,240
going on here. So what what you should

1293
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:00,000
do is you're basically making a series

1294
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:01,839
of distinct scripts, right, that are

1295
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,920
going to do different things. The

1296
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:07,359
location one is pretty pretty simple in

1297
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,160
the sense that I've already given you a

1298
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:14,240
formula right here. You calculate the

1299
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:17,839
numerical which is this. what is the uh

1300
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:21,119
income minus poverty times population

1301
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:23,599
and then calculate them all sum them

1302
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,720
together and then normalize which is

1303
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,799
this process and if you say normalize to

1304
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,520
the to the AI it's going to understand

1305
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:32,799
what you mean it's a very common term

1306
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,440
you're saying I'm looking to calculate a

1307
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,880
normalized score of this equation across

1308
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,319
this set and it should be able to be

1309
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:41,839
like and then you you calculate that you

1310
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:43,760
write it into the sheet and get all

1311
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:46,000
those normalized scores in there and

1312
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,119
then you know sense check them because

1313
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,960
you can write the formula yourself right

1314
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,160
as well and see if it got it right.

1315
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,920
That's called making sure the math

1316
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,039
match.

1317
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:59,280
Um so then then doing the same thing uh

1318
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,920
with the the service piece is is

1319
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:04,000
important. Um

1320
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:06,480
let's see

1321
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,720
that should be straightforward because

1322
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,400
services are

1323
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,240
or like the niche you're going to have

1324
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,319
that data. So you're literally plugging

1325
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:17,599
this in and then you're just doing a

1326
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:19,359
normalization on those, right? So if

1327
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,799
you're leaving out rat or whatever

1328
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,799
you're not tracking, even though it

1329
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:25,520
might exist in that other sheet and give

1330
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:27,359
you a weird number, you know that these

1331
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,160
three numbers added together are going

1332
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:31,520
to equal one when normalized. Right.

1333
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,000
Because if you add these all together,

1334
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,119
they equal one,

1335
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,480
right?

1336
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,880
Right. If we did the sum,

1337
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,520
yeah, it equals one. See?

1338
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,880
So you got to normalize the niche,

1339
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,039
normalize the the location calculation.

1340
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:54,960
Then the keyword I've kind of given you

1341
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:57,440
that uh code at least generally. Um so

1342
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:03,440
the trick in that one is going to be

1343
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:06,160
first locating the uh

1344
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,559
like dividing these by location and geo

1345
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:12,000
first of all dividing them by service

1346
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:14,240
and then con considering service and geo

1347
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,920
as like a bucket that is distinct from

1348
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:18,000
all other buckets and you're calculating

1349
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,920
your scores on this and then you have to

1350
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,960
figure out which of these are core

1351
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:25,839
keywords and which of them are location

1352
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,280
uh keywords, right? Or geo keywords.

1353
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:30,079
Treat them and sort them into their

1354
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:33,839
separate buckets. Calculate their scores

1355
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:36,720
and then look these up again by finding

1356
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:38,559
the service plus the keyword plus geo or

1357
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,160
sorry not the service the the geo and

1358
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,480
then the keyword geo because you need to

1359
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,559
find which wildlife pest control to

1360
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,640
write to and then you pop that keyword

1361
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,400
score here and they should all be very

1362
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:52,799
similar. It should almost look at like

1363
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:56,240
it repeats. If you compare the Riverview

1364
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:59,119
Raccoon to the Port Newport Richie

1365
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,480
raccoon, the numbers should repeat, if

1366
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,839
that makes sense. It should be like the

1367
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,280
exact same thing. If it's working

1368
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,280
correctly. If you see it's not working

1369
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,720
correctly and they're different, then

1370
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,119
you know that there's a problem in what

1371
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,359
you did. Um,

1372
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,640
so the keyword score one should be

1373
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:15,119
straightforward. You've got the code

1374
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,520
inside that chat GPT. Then you need to

1375
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:21,440
make another formula to calculate the

1376
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:23,200
ranking using you can you can use my

1377
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,480
code example on the last one and say hey

1378
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,200
we need to make a simplified version of

1379
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:30,559
this where we have a scale of 1 to 10

1380
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:33,359
and we need to make uh a decay curve on

1381
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,960
that with a kappa as an input and

1382
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:37,920
anything above 10 should be

1383
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,760
automatically zero. Um but one through

1384
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,839
10 should be graded on this curve. You

1385
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,200
know if it's a kappa of one it's linear.

1386
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:47,039
If it's if it's a decay curve that has a

1387
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:50,480
high kappa then it'll look like that

1388
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:52,079
like a scimitar almost right. Um and so

1389
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,640
then you can set the kappa from the

1390
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:57,680
sheet which we did in that config. So

1391
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:00,319
you take the config here uh the keyword

1392
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:03,760
ones there's a there's a a keyword um

1393
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:06,880
split or keyword partition split which

1394
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,880
is a zero to one. There's a a keyword um

1395
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,960
kappa and then there should be a ranking

1396
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,799
kappa. And the ranking cap is what you'd

1397
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,039
use in the ranking calculation. Again,

1398
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:16,720
you'll notice that those values seem

1399
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,240
very similar to all the other ones. All

1400
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,599
the ones will have the same value. All

1401
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,880
the twos will have the same value. All

1402
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:22,640
the threes will have the same value

1403
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,839
because it's a pretty straightforward

1404
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:28,960
calculation, right? Um and then that

1405
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:33,280
final one is the end of the algo, right?

1406
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:35,280
So I think uh I can give you that

1407
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:39,359
formula now for calculating the final

1408
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:41,200
score if you want. Um, it it's mostly

1409
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,680
just multiplication of the different

1410
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:47,440
values, right? Take the Riverview

1411
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:50,160
location score times the raccoon removal

1412
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,000
niche score times the keyword score

1413
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:53,440
times the ranking score and you get the

1414
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
final keyword score. You basically

1415
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,240
multiply all the components together,

1416
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,760
right?

1417
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,240
And then it out and then that's your

1418
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:04,640
score, right? Um, and then from there

1419
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:07,760
you've got an extremely atomic view of

1420
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:10,240
what that keyword ranking has worked to

1421
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:14,559
a client. Uh, the only other way to

1422
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:17,199
enrich that would be to bring in uh

1423
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:20,799
perhaps more competition data uh to the

1424
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:23,679
keyword or um value in jobs based off of

1425
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:26,159
it. Right? A raccoon job is an average

1426
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,480
value of this. Uh, you know what I mean?

1427
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:31,359
So that's the only other way to to to

1428
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:34,480
add value. Um

1429
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:37,040
which we could bake in as well. Uh

1430
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,359
so yeah,

1431
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:42,000
those are that's basically how it works.

1432
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:43,759
Um so

1433
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,400
I I want to kind of sum it up a little

1434
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:49,120
bit more in a mind map. Uh the tasks are

1435
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:54,960
to

1436
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:57,359
create a location um score

1437
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,520
script.

1438
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:02,880
Create a

1439
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,960
niche score script.

1440
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,719
Create a

1441
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:13,040
keyword score script.

1442
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:16,000
create a um ranking

1443
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:18,239
score script.

1444
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,920
And then finally, you're going to create

1445
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:25,679
a or merge

1446
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:29,120
score scripts

1447
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:31,520
um and factor

1448
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,319
uh scores, which is basically going to

1449
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:38,319
be four,

1450
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:40,159
you know. Let's just go back here.

1451
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,560
for

1452
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:44,880
wildlife removal as a service in

1453
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,040
Riverview for the keyword wildlife pest

1454
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,960
control. I'm going to multiply the

1455
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,440
keyword score, the ranking modifier

1456
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,520
score, the location score, and the niche

1457
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,880
score together and get the final score.

1458
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,280
You know, it's just multiply, multiply,

1459
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,159
multiply, multiply. Um, and then it

1460
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:03,760
should come out to a final score.

1461
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:07,840
Uh and what you'll find is if you were

1462
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:11,120
to have number one rankings across all

1463
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,800
terms uh in all markets, if you were to

1464
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,040
then add all the final scores together,

1465
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,400
they should equal one.

1466
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,719
You'll never get that because you're not

1467
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,640
getting perfect rankings. But if you

1468
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:22,560
were to have ideal results, they would

1469
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,400
average out to one if you added all the

1470
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,760
final scores together, if that makes

1471
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:31,040
sense. Um

1472
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,040
which would be super cool.

1473
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,239
Uh,

1474
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,239
so

1475
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:39,679
questions

1476
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:42,400
because this is a lot. I'm kind of

1477
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:44,000
asking you to I I hope I've broken it

1478
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,760
down well and I think I solved the

1479
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,600
hardest part and given you a script for

1480
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,960
it. Um, but I think the keyword part is

1481
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,560
going to be hard. I think the the

1482
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:56,480
ranking one will be um

1483
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,760
somewhat hard because it's like a weird

1484
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,440
calculation but it should be

1485
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:03,440
straightforward too. Uh and you got the

1486
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,800
harder version to look at to see you

1487
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:10,320
know to help understand it right. Um so

1488
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,560
do you have any questions on it?

1489
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,800
Nothing right now. I'll probably have

1490
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,360
have to like review this recording.

1491
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,679
Yeah. So,

1492
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,440
yeah. I expect

1493
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,679
review the recording and then, you know,

1494
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,480
you can ask me questions over over

1495
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:26,400
Friday, the weekend or whatever. Um, I'd

1496
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:29,199
like to see you writing values to all of

1497
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:30,719
these uh as best you can, right? Um, and

1498
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,719
then we can review it kind of Monday.

1499
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:36,080
Probably Tuesday will be the best day to

1500
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:37,920
dive deeper into it because um we got

1501
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:42,320
more time because Monday's got that nine

1502
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:45,199
o'clock. Uh but generally

1503
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:48,400
uh it is somewhat straightforward if you

1504
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:50,560
just think about like take the you know

1505
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,440
we've made a new a new sheet so you

1506
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,400
don't have to worry about your old

1507
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,360
script. You don't have to worry about

1508
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,880
integrating with any old code. Um you're

1509
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,120
just thinking about writing one script

1510
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,719
at a time and dropping the values in and

1511
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:03,600
then adding to it. Okay, now that we've

1512
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,520
written the location one, that location

1513
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,800
score is still in memory. we've written

1514
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:09,199
it, but now we're going to focus on

1515
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,360
writing the niche ones. And then as you

1516
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,719
build that script over time, when you

1517
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,400
hit the run button, you should be

1518
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,320
writing the locations every time and

1519
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,000
then the niche every time. And it it

1520
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,960
just starts to expand, if that makes

1521
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,880
sense. So you go bang bang bang bang

1522
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,400
bang bang. And then eventually once

1523
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,040
you've done all the keyword and all the

1524
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:31,920
ranking score ones, then the last one is

1525
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:34,640
just go into uh this guy's row, right?

1526
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,080
um go for each of these keywords and

1527
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,199
calculate the value and put it in.

1528
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,960
Calculate the value, put it in,

1529
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:42,320
calculate the value, put it in. That

1530
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:46,560
type of a thing. I'd say avoid at all

1531
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:49,120
cost the need to go reference data from

1532
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:52,000
the script except for at the beginning,

1533
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,760
if that makes sense. Um I would load in

1534
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,560
at the beginning of the script the

1535
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,159
keyword ranking data. Uh basically all

1536
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,640
the objects, right? Like you could you

1537
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:04,719
could say um I'm going to

1538
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,920
uh pull in my location stuff. I'm going

1539
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:10,880
to pull in my um niche stuff. I'm going

1540
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:14,640
to pull in my keyword rankings. Uh and

1541
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:16,960
then though I'm writing data out, I'm

1542
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,480
not ever having to go reference that

1543
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,960
written data again to continue my

1544
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:24,320
operation. I'm only writing it out as a

1545
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,960
log, right? And that's just so we can

1546
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:29,199
audit it later. Uh, and then that'll

1547
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:33,600
make it easy for us to tell if the the

1548
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:34,719
map does indeed map. Uh, and then if you

1549
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,040
if you just kind of follow that

1550
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,880
trajectory, you can do keyword last and

1551
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,080
do ranking before it, like the actual

1552
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,440
ranking score, because that should be

1553
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,920
simpler. And then keyword will be the

1554
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,960
most complex one. And then at the end,

1555
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,360
as long as your your rows match, um, you

1556
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,040
should be able to, uh, do the

1557
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:53,040
multiplication very easily, I would

1558
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,040
think. Uh, it kind of depends on how you

1559
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,760
want to organize your objects, but I

1560
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:00,239
leave that up to you. Um, if you feel

1561
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,760
like you can't hack it or whatever and

1562
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,679
you're just like, I tried and it totally

1563
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,040
screwed up, we obviously know enough

1564
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,960
about the problem that I could we could

1565
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,120
build the script on the next call and

1566
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,400
just try it that way. Um, but I want to

1567
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,199
make sure you struggle with it first

1568
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:16,800
because I think that's useful to to

1569
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,400
development. So, um, cool. You got the

1570
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,080
you got the chat. So, there's the code

1571
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:25,320
in there. Um, yeah. Right on. Good luck

1572
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,320
to you.

1573
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,840
Um, yeah, don't forget to send me the

1574
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:31,600
recording, Gordon.

1575
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,360
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, if you don't see it,

1576
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,080
remind me just because, uh, that's taken

1577
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:38,960
a while to process long recordings. So,

1578
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:41,120
yeah, I'll send you a message.

1579
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,120
Sounds good. I'll see you later.

1580
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,679
See you later, Gordon. Have a good one.

1581
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,679
You, too. Byebye.
